[00:14.04] I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[00:21.18] Just like the ones I used to know
[00:26.65] Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
[00:33.50] To hear sleigh bells in the snow
[00:49.50] 
[00:40.42] I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[00:47.38] With every Christmas card I write
[00:52.84] May your days be merry and bright
[00:59.38] And may all your Christmases be white
[01:17.88] 
[01:33.15] I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[01:40.03] Just like the ones I used to know
[01:45.27] So may your days be merry and bright
[01:52.28] And may all your Christmases be white
[02:10.78] 
[01:58.46] May your days be merry and bright
[02:05.06] And may all your Christmases be white
