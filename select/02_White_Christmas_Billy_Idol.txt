I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those tree-tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, oh

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"

Well I'm, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days, may your days be merry and bright
Oh so bright
And may all your Christmases be white
So white, white Christmas
They got to be white
So white, white Christmas

You know I'm dreaming of you
