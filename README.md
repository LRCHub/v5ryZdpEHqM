[00:04.51] I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[00:14.45] Just like the ones I used to know
[00:22.64] Where the treetops glisten and children listen
[00:34.35] To hear sleigh bells in the snow
[00:50.35] 
[00:42.57] I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[00:55.37] With every Christmas card I write
[01:03.44] May your days be merry and bright
[01:14.37] And may all your Christmases be white
[01:32.87] 
[01:26.07] I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[01:36.98] Just like the ones I used to know
[01:45.03] Where the treetops glisten and children listen
[01:56.83] To hear sleigh bells in the snow
[02:12.83] 
[02:04.98] I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[02:17.66] With every Christmas card I write
[02:26.62] May your days be merry and bright
[02:37.57] And may all your Christmases be white
